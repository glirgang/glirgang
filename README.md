## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a **Frontend Engineer** with **4+ years of experience** (2.5+ in professional environments) building web and mobile applications. I specialize in **software architecture**, **performance optimization**, and creating scalable interfaces that solve real business problems.

I'm not just a code executor — I participate in product alignment meetings, identify gaps in requirements, create technical specifications, and lead projects from planning to delivery. I'm responsible for **architectural decisions**, **code standards**, and **technical infrastructure** of the frontend in my current team.

🏢 **Current:** Frontend Engineer at **[DWV](https://site.dwvapp.com.br/)** — Brazil's largest B2B real estate platform (600+ developers, 40k+ brokers)

🎯 **Goal:** Work remotely as a technical reference in Frontend, contributing to products with real impact

🎓 **Education:** Systems Analysis and Development (graduating 2025)

🌍 **Location:** Santa Catarina, Brazil | Open to remote opportunities worldwide

<br/>

## 🧠 How I Think About Code

I believe frontend is more than "making things pretty" — it's about **architecture that scales**, **maintainable code**, and **exceptional user experience**.

```typescript
const myApproach = {
  architecture: {
    pattern: 'Clean Architecture with layered separation',
    layers: ['Domain', 'Infrastructure', 'Application', 'Presentation'],
    philosophy: 'Business logic isolated from UI, reusable and testable'
  },
  
  stateManagement: {
    preferred: 'Zustand',
    reason: 'Avoids Context API re-render issues, simpler API, better DX',
    advanced: 'Singleton + Closures for WebSocket management'
  },
  
  decisionMaking: {
    style: 'Data-driven, always questioning defaults',
    example: 'Chose Zustand over Context after profiling re-render patterns'
  }
}
```

<br/>

## 🏗️ Architecture & Patterns I Use

My projects follow a **layered architecture** inspired by Clean Architecture and DDD principles:

| Layer | Responsibility | Examples |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| **Domain** | Core entities, types, interfaces, GraphQL schemas, permissions | `User.ts`, `user.graphql`, `userPermissions.ts` |
| **Infrastructure** | External communication — APIs, REST, GraphQL clients, WebSocket, integrations | `userService.ts`, `apiClient.ts` |
| **Application** | Global utilities, helpers, constants, translations | `formatDate.ts`, `i18n/`, `constants/` |
| **Presentation** | Pages, components, state management, UI logic | `UserProfile.tsx`, `useUserStore.ts` |

**Why this matters:** Code stays organized as the project scales. New devs onboard faster. Refactoring is safer.

## 💡 What Sets Me Apart

```typescript
const differentials = {
  technical: [
    'I architect before I code — layered structure, clear responsibilities',
    'I understand why, not just how — can explain tradeoffs of technical decisions',
    'I care about DX — clean code, good patterns, easy onboarding for teammates'
  ],
  
  professional: [
    'I identify gaps in requirements before they become bugs',
    'I create my own action plans from abstract scopes',
    'I proactively propose improvements (not just execute tasks)'
  ],
  
  mindset: [
    'Ownership mentality — I treat the product as if it were mine',
    'Continuous learner — currently diving deep into performance optimization',
    'Team player — I document decisions so knowledge is shared'
  ]
}
```
